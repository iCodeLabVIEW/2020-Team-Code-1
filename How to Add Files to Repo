TO FORK A REPOSITORY:
1. Open your web browser and navigate to https://github.com/FRC-5503/2020-Team-Code

2. In the top left corner of the screen, you should see a "Fork" button. Click it.

3. This will create a copy of the repository on your account.

4. Choose which account to fork it to.

TO INITIALIZE REMOTE REPOSITORY:
1. Open Git Bash. A command line should appear.

2. Type "cd /c/" without quotes.

3. Type "mkdir Github" without quotes.

4. Type "cd /c/Github" without quotes.

5. Type "mkdir 2020-Team-Code" without quotes.

6. Type "cd /c/Github/2020-Team-Code" without quotes.

7. Type git clone "https://github.com/FRC-5503/2020-Team-Code.git" WITH QUOTES!

TO COMMIT (ADD) FILES AND PUSH THEM TO THE REMOTE REPOSITORY:
1. Open File Explorer (explorer.exe)

2. Navigate to the folder you want to copy (ex: C:\Documents\LabVIEW Data\2020 TEAM CODE)

3. Copy THE FOLDER, not the contents of the folder to C:\Github\2020-Team-Code\

4. Paste the folder in the 2020-Team-Code folder.

5. Open Git Bash.

6. Navigate to the remote repository you created earlier (should be at /c/Github/2020-Team-Code)

7. Type "git add *" without quotes. The asterisk will add all the files in the folder.

8. Type git commit -m "Put whatever here" WITH QUOTES!

9. Type "git push -u origin master" without quotes.

10. It should take a second or two to tell you that it is uploading to the repo.
